My name is Li Duan. I am a research associate at the University of Edinburgh, focusing on graph neural networks and robotic localisation. I am also a final-year PhD student at the University of Glasgow, where my research includes robotic perception and manipulation of garments. I graduated with BEng in Electronic and Electric Engineering at the University of Glasgow in 2018. My research interests include robotic perception and manipulation of deformable objects, human-robot interaction and robotic applications in other fields.

I am open to collaborations with researchers in the robotic research field. If you are interested in collaborations, please get in touch with me by l [dot] duan [dot] 1 [At] research [dot] gla [dot] ac [dot] uk.
